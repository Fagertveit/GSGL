<h1>GameSaw GameLibrary</h1>
<p>Gamesaw GameLibrary is a HTML5 JS gamelibrary that concentrates around the traditional concept of a gameloop.</p>
<p>To handle graphics we use Surface's that we can update at any time from the game loop, the game can have several surfaces to maximize rendering efficiency</p>
<p>The plan is to be able to combine 2d and 3d surfaces and render a colorful environment with particles and classic 2d graphics</p>
